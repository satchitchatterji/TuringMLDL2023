Week 1: Project Proposal
Students submit a proposal outlining the project they plan to work on, including a brief description of the problem they will be solving, the data they will be using, and the machine learning algorithms they plan to implement.
Week 2: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Students begin working on collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the data they will be using for their project.
They should submit a report outlining the steps they took to prepare the data and any challenges they encountered.

Week 3: Model Implementation
Students implement their chosen machine learning algorithms and begin training their models.
They should submit a report outlining the approaches they took and the results they obtained.

Week 4: Model Evaluation and Refinement
Students evaluate their models using performance metrics and begin making adjustments to improve their performance.
They should submit a report outlining the results of the evaluation, any challenges they encountered and the adjustments they made.

Week 5: Final Project Report and Presentation
Students submit their final project report, which should include a detailed description of their work, their results and any conclusions and future work. Students also give a presentation summarizing their project to the class.
It's important to keep in mind that this schedule is just an example, and you may need to adjust the deadlines and requirements based on the specific course and student's backgrounds. Additionally, providing flexibility in the schedule is important, as some students may need more time on certain aspects of the project, or some of the students are working on different types of projects.

Also, it's important to provide students with guidance and support throughout the process and to set clear expectations for what is expected in each submission.
