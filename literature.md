## Links to useful literature
These are only a selection of thousands of good resources on ML, at least those I found useful so far.

Notes:

- Jaeger's *Neural Networks* lecture notes is the book that I would recommend to a beginner interested in (surprise!) neural networks. The *Machine Learning* lecture notes also contains broader themes in the world of ML.
