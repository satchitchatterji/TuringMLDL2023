Lecture 2: Supervised Learning
Linear regression
Logistic regression
Decision trees and random forests
Support vector machines

In Lecture 2, when discussing supervised learning algorithms, it would be appropriate to mention overfitting and underfitting in the context of decision trees and random forests, which are particularly prone to overfitting.

In Lecture 2, when discussing supervised learning algorithms, you could introduce the concept of loss functions in the context of linear and logistic regression. For example, you could mention the mean squared error loss for linear regression and the cross-entropy loss for logistic regression.

In Week 2, when exploring and preprocessing the data, it could be a good opportunity to introduce the concept of bias-variance tradeoff, and how the complexity of a model affects its generalization performance.

Lecture 3: Unsupervised Learning
k-means clustering
Hierarchical clustering
Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PCA)
Anomaly detection
GMM

In Week 3, when implementing the machine learning models, you could have students experiment with different regularization techniques and include it as part of the implementation. For example, when building a linear regression model, you could have students experiment with L1 and L2 regularization and compare the results.

In Week 3, when implementing the machine learning models, you could have students experiment with different model architectures, and discuss how the model's complexity affects its bias and variance. For example, when building a decision tree model, you could have students experiment with different tree depths and observe how it affects the bias and variance of the model.

Lecture 4: Deep Learning
Introduction to neural networks
Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
Hands-on experience with building and training a deep learning model using popular deep learning libraries (e.g. TensorFlow or PyTorch)

In Lecture 4, when discussing deep learning, you could discuss loss functions in the context of neural networks. For example, you could mention the mean squared error loss for regression problems and the cross-entropy loss for classification problems.

In Week 4, when evaluating and refining the models, you could have students focus on regularization as a technique to improve the generalization and reduce overfitting. This includes experimenting with different regularization techniques and observing the effect on the model's performance.

In Week 4, when evaluating and refining the models, you could have students focus on the bias-variance tradeoff as a way to improve the generalization and reduce overfitting. This includes experimenting with different model architectures, and adjusting the model capacity to find a balance between bias and variance.

Lecture 5: Advanced Machine Learning
Hyperparameter tuning
Regularization techniques
Ensemble methods
Recap
Applications of machine learning (e.g. computer vision, natural language processing)
Note: This is a broad outline and of course will depend on the actual syllabus of the course, but it is a good starting point for building a machine learning course for undergrad students with a balance of theory and hands-on practice.

In Lecture 5, when discussing advanced machine learning, you could have a section on model selection and evaluation, where you could introduce the concepts of overfitting and underfitting, and discuss techniques for preventing or mitigating them such as cross-validation and regularization.

In Lecture 5, when discussing advanced machine learning, you could have a section on loss functions, where you could cover more advanced loss functions such as the hinge loss, or the Wasserstein loss.

In Week 5, as part of the final project report and presentation, students should include a section discussing the bias-variance tradeoff and how it affected their model, and how it helped them improve the performance of the model.

In Week 5, as part of the final project report and presentation, students should include a section discussing regularization and its impact on their model, and how it helped them improve the performance of the model.

Week 1: Project Proposal
Students submit a proposal outlining the project they plan to work on, including a brief description of the problem they will be solving, the data they will be using, and the machine learning algorithms they plan to implement.
Week 2: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Students begin working on collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the data they will be using for their project.
They should submit a report outlining the steps they took to prepare the data and any challenges they encountered.

Week 3: Model Implementation
Students implement their chosen machine learning algorithms and begin training their models.
They should submit a report outlining the approaches they took and the results they obtained.

Week 4: Model Evaluation and Refinement
Students evaluate their models using performance metrics and begin making adjustments to improve their performance.
They should submit a report outlining the results of the evaluation, any challenges they encountered and the adjustments they made.

Week 5: Final Project Report and Presentation
Students submit their final project report, which should include a detailed description of their work, their results and any conclusions and future work. Students also give a presentation summarizing their project to the class.
It's important to keep in mind that this schedule is just an example, and you may need to adjust the deadlines and requirements based on the specific course and student's backgrounds. Additionally, providing flexibility in the schedule is important, as some students may need more time on certain aspects of the project, or some of the students are working on different types of projects.

Also, it's important to provide students with guidance and support throughout the process and to set clear expectations for what is expected in each submission.
