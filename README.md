# Turing Machine Learning & Deep Learning
*Author: Satchit Chatterji (satchit.chatterji@gmail.com)*

This repository contains the teaching material for the course _Turing Machine Learning & Deep Learning_ that I teach on behalf of [Turing Students Rotterdam](https://www.tstudents.nl) at Erasmus University, Rotterdam. The 2023 edition is currently running from the 12/05/2023 to 09/06/2023 and this repo is updated as it is taught. It is an introductory, hands-on, project-based lecture series on using Python for machine learning tasks. 

Feedback/suggestions may be made on the issues page or sent directly to me via email.

Please feel free to use this material as you wish!
